<!-- DEFINITIONS OF TAGS : -->
<!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. 
Also DOCTYPE is not case sensitive but generally capital form is written. -->

<!-- 
The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).

Note: You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. -->

<!-- The <title> element: defines a title in the browser toolbar
        provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        displays a title for the page in search-engine results -->
<!-- 
        The <body> tag defines the document's body.

            The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            
            Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document. -->
