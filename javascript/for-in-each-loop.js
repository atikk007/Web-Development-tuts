/* JavaScript template literals:-
Prior to ES6, we use single quotes (') or double quotes (") to wrap a string literal. At that time, the strings have very limited functionality. To help us in solving more complex problems, ES6 template literals provide the syntax that allows you to work with strings in a much cleaner way. In ES6, we can create a template literal by wrapping the string in backticks as follows: */

We can write a Multiline string
It provides the ability to substitute part of the string for the values of variables or expressions. This feature is also called string interpolation.
