<!-- 
    Onload attribute is used to write inline javascript. With things like alert we can't use double "" quotation marks in strings because our compiler might confuse string tag as closing tag for onload attribute. That's why single ''  quotation mark is used. 
-->

<!-- Inline js is not preferred since it makes debugging hard -->
